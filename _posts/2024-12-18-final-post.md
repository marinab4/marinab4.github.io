Final "Tips": My advice to future students of programming fundamentals (taking the same course I have or otherwise), would be to allot more time than you expect for almost everything. Especially as a beginner, even if you've thought through your programs quickly, implementing the code itself and debugging when you're not used to the process and don't know what to look for when you get an error means that things take time. Also, I went into the course imagining that programming problems were a lot like a math worksheet, where in most cases the time it takes to solve a problem doesn't matter as long as you get there and your logic is sound. To some extent this applies to programming as well, and technically you can take as much time to write the code as you want, but once you've got a function functionning, efficiency and readability do matter more, especially as projects get larger and take up more space and time.
