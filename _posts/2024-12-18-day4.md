Daily Report: I finished “integer to roman” as my first problem from LeetCode. I had copied my code from the hundreds place for the tens and ones places, but left "100" instead of "10" and a lack of floor division when subtracting from num to keep track of the symbols and quantities I'd already represented. Once I fixed this issue and got rid of previous code attempts the function both looked cleaner and worked as I desired. It was satisfying to see my code finally work, especially because before I'd been confused about why it didn't. For my next steps I've identified my second Leetcode problem and written the doc string and test cases (Longest Valid Parentheses), so I'll start working on the implementation of that later on today. Because of unfortunate time restrictions, I've changed the scope of the project to be only 2 problems instead of 5, but my second problem is a Hard one instead of Medium.
