Daily Report: I chose "integer to roman" for my first problem from LeetCode. Yesterday I wrote the doc string and test cases and the code for cases where digits are not 9 or 4. Today I wrote a first attempt at cases with 9's, 4's, 90's etc. that didn't fully work. I realized that I had some if statements indented strangely so certain variables were called without assignment, and I worked on fixing that issue for the code about the tens place. I have yet to fully fix the issue for the other places, but I have an idea of how to do it. It was somewhat disappointing to find that my initial code didn't work, but it was my first attempt/draft, and now I have some structure and a better sense for how the code works/should work. I chose "integer to roman" as a problem because it sounded interesting and also similar to previous problems I'd completed where digits and integers were converted to english, but the roman numeral system uses groupings of 5's in addition to 10's, so it's proving to be both more interesting and challenging than I'd anticipated. My next steps will be to get my function operational for digits with 4's and 9's, then clean up the code for efficiency and readability.
