## About Me

I am currently a high school student at Uni High. I don't have a lot of experience coding, but I wanted to learn so I am taking an introducory programming course. I hope to keep learning and growing as a programmer in the future!

## About My Project

This site is a progress log for my final project for the course Programming Fundamentals. For this project, I will choose and solve multiple LeetCode problems, complete with proper documentation and explanation.
